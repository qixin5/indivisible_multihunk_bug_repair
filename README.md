# Artifact for Detecting, Creating, Repairing, and Understanding Indivisible Multi-Hunk Bugs

## About

This is the artifact associated with the paper "Detecting, Creating, Repairing, and Understanding Indivisible Multi-Hunk Bugs" accepted by FSE'24. 
The paper has three parts presenting: (1) an approach proposed to detect and create indivisible multi-hunk bugs; 
(2) an evaluation of existing repair techniques based on these bugs; and 
(3) a study of how these bugs are repaired by the developers and the existing tools.
Correspondingly, the artifact has three key components. We use seperate links for the components for (1) and (2). Please see the sub-sections below.
The component for (3) can be accessed [here](bug_repair_study) from this repo.
The repo contains the following files and directories.

- **README.md**: This file.
- **LICENSE.md**: The license file.
- **REQUIREMENTS.txt**: The requirement file includes the environment requirement for experiment replication.
- **STATUS.txt**: This file shows the badgets we applied for and includes the reasons.
- **INSTALL.txt**: The file includes installation guidelines.
- **bug_repair_study**: This directory contains materials related to (3), which is our study of how indivisible multi-hunk bugs are repaired by the developers and the existing tools.
