To replicate our experiments, a user should use a machine that has a >32 GB memory and runs a Linux system (we recommend a Ubuntu 20.04 system) with a Docker engine installed. To run the repair tool AlphaRepair, the user should consider a machine with a >16 GB GPU (otherwise the repair can be very slow). If the user chooses not to use Docker for replication, she/he should refer to the GitHub page of the target tool (either our tool for indivisible bug detection and creation or any of the repair tools) accessible from the artifact for specific requirement.
