We refer the user to our CatenaD4J repo (https://github.com/universetraveller/CatenaD4j) and the repair tool repos contained in our RepairResults repo (https://github.com/BaiGeiQiShi/RepairResults) for tool installation instructions.

Note that the installation for some of the tools (including our tool developed for indivisible bug detection and creation) involves using curl and apt-get commands to download files. Please ensure that you have a **stable and accessible** network so that files can be downloaded as expected.
