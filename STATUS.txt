We apply for all the three badgets: available, functional, and reusable. We've prepared an artifact including the tool we developed, our result data, and other materials for experiment replication. We've made the artifact available and created a DOI. We've also documented the artifact showing what it contains and the instructions used for tool installation, test, and experiment replication. To facilitate replication, we also prepared Dockerfiles.
